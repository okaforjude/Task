### Task1

This project designs a program that determines the award a person competing in a
triathlon will receive.

The program reads in the times (in minutes) for all three events of a
triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculate and
display the total time taken to complete the triathlon.

The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to
complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes.
